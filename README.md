**NOTE**: All copyrights for this project belong entirely to the Rocketseat team, not me. I just participated in the NLW on the date of the event and I applied my learnings to it, in the end, it's the same project as the tutors. It was excellent and I am very grateful to have participated, and yes, I learned a lot.

Since I finished technical school, I joined the JS ecosystem, and it's been great.

This will be my GitHub update in 2022, this being "my" gift to anyone accessing this repository in the future. Thanks to everyone who followed my journey as a fullstack developer.
